# Gulp Hands-on Project

Hands-on, multi-step exercise to discover gulp. How to automate multiple aspect of a static web page using gulp.

More details can be found at this [post](http://helloworldeverything.com/blog/programming/web/gulp_practice/)

<br>

## How to start

From cloning the master branch of this repo.

```sh git clone https://github.com/PrincessMadMath/hwe_gulp-introduction.git ```

You will have multiple goals for the automatization of the process:

0. Setup gulp.
1. Copying files into the build folder.
2. Minifyng everything.
3. Add sass support
4. Support lives reload

## Note

#### Setup gulp

Follow the [official documentation](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) 

#### Support lives reload step

I was doing this project side-by-side with my [gulp-starter-pack](https://github.com/PrincessMadMath/helloworld-gulp-starter) so this part is heavily re-factored. (sorry but considering the probability of someone using this, I was like "meh!")
